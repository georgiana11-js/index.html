<h1>No Excuses!: The Power of Self-Discipline</h1>
<p>Most people think success comes from good luck or enormous talent, but many successful people achieve their accomplishments in a simpler way: through self-discipline. No Excuses! shows you how you can achieve success in all three major areas of your life, including your personal goals, business and money goals, and overall happiness.</p>
<p>Each of the 21 chapters in this book shows you how to be more disciplined in one aspect of your life, with end-of-chapter exercises to help you apply the "no excuses" approach to your own life. With these guidelines, you can learn how to be more successful in everything you do --instead of wistfully envying others you think are just "luckier" than you. A little self-discipline goes a long way -- so stop making excuses and read this book!</p>
